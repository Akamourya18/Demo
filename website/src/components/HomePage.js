          When people carpool, they reduce the need for 9 to 13 vehicles on the
          road per shared car. Reduce Cost For a person with a longer than
          average commute (e.g., more than 20 KM) and carpooling 250 days a
          year, the potential savings in a two-person carpool could exceed
          â‚¹10,000! This does not include any savings in parking or toll costs.
